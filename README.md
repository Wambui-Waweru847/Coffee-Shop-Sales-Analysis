#### Introduction
This project presents an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to visualize and analyze key business metrics for a coffee retail business. The dashboard summarizes performance across multiple product categories, store locations, and time periods. It provides real-time insights into total revenue, sales volume, and transaction counts â€” enabling data-driven decision-making for business stakeholders.

#### Problem Statement
Coffee businesses often operate in competitive environments with fluctuating customer demand, seasonal variations, and complex product lines. Without a centralized and intuitive view of sales data, identifying high-performing products, underperforming stores, or growth opportunities becomes difficult.

This project addresses the need for a consolidated, visual reporting tool that helps business managers and analysts:

- Monitor overall performance at a glance.

- Compare monthly revenue trends and sales volumes.

- Identify top-selling products and categories.

- Track store-level contribution to revenue and quantity sold.

By leveraging Power BI, the dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights that can inform inventory decisions, marketing strategies, and business growth.

#### Methodology
To address this challenge, sales data was collected, cleaned, and transformed into an interactive dashboard that would empower business stakeholders to:

- View trends over time

- Drill down into product categories

- Filter by region and time period

- Compare performance metrics across locations

#### Analysis Approach
The analysis focused on:

- Monthly and cumulative revenue tracking

- Regional sales comparison

- Product-level performance analysis

- Identifying peak sales months and underperforming segments

The dashboard used:

- KPI cards for high-level revenue summaries

- Bar and column charts for regional and product comparisons

- Date slicers and filters to allow flexible exploration

#### Key Insights
- Sales peaked in Q2, possibly due to seasonal promotions or demand spikes.

- Espresso-based drinks and packaged coffee products were the top-performing items.

- Hell's Kitchen consistently outperformed others, while Asoria showed the lowest performance.

- Certain months had significant dips in sales, which may require further analysis of marketing or inventory strategies.

#### Business Impact
- Helped stakeholders quickly identify underperforming regions and products.

- Provided a dynamic tool for regular sales reviews without the need for manual reports.

- Enabled data-driven decisions in product planning and marketing.

- Created a foundation for scaling insights across new regions or product lines.

#### Conclusion
The Coffee Sales Dashboard transformed raw sales data into a visually rich, interactive report that supports strategic decision-making. With clear insights into what drives revenue, where weaknesses lie, and when performance shifts occur, the business can now take proactive steps to optimize operations, marketing, and inventory. This project showcases the power of self-service BI tools like Power BI in unlocking the value of everyday data.
